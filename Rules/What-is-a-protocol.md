A protocol is the method that allows computers to 'talk' across a network. Below is a simple example of how a protocol works:
	
*	TCP 3-Way Handshake occurs.
*	Client system sends a Client HELLO message
*	Server system responds with a Server HELLO message
*	Both side exchange key information to determine what type of encryption to use.
*	Both sides begin encrypted communication.
