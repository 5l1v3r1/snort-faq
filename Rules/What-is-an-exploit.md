The counterpart to a vulnerability is the exploit, without that exploit there would not be any practical method for utilizing a vulnerability. Exploits are the methodologies or techniques that are utilized to take advantage of vulnerabilities. This is also a very broad definition as it includes everything from the standard proof of concept (PoC) exploit code to strategies for picking apart the defense on a football field.
