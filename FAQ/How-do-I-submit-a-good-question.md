Many of the questions asked on the Snort list contain very poor or incomplete information, so this is a guide on how to ask a good question:

*	Explain the problem, what you are trying to accomplish.
*	Paste your snort.conf file at the very end of the email.
*	Paste the command line argument you are using to start Snort.
*	Paste any output you receive (an error, a crash, any verbiage that's on the screen.)	

This will get us started to be able to help you figure out your problem.
