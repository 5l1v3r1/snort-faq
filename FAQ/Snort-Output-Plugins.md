## Snort Output Plugins ##

Snort's official output method is unified2.  

There are several tools (such as barnyard2) that read the unified2 format and then further output Snort's alerts into the chosen format you'd like.  (Database, syslog, etc)

Snort has no currently plans to support any further output plugins, including SNMP.
