## Can I Have Help With My School Work? ##


Generally, the Snort lists are very helpful in solving problems.  However, occasionally a question is posted to the list asking for help with homework, an assignment from college, or similar.  

We do not provide help with homework or assignments.  If you ask for help with *aspects* of the assignment, we can help with that.  But we will not help you with your entire project.
