## What is the relationship between Snort and Cisco? ##

Sourcefire was founded in 2001 by [Martin Roesch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Roesch), the original author of Snort, in response to demand for a commercial version of the popular technology. Sourcefire was acquired by Cisco Systems on October 7, 2013. Our mission is to combine our open source roots with proprietary innovation to deliver the most effective and comprehensive real-time network defense solutions on the planet.
