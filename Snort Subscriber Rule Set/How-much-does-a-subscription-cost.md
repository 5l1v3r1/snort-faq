<table>
        <tr>
          <th>Subscription Type </th>
          <th><div align="center">Pricing</div></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> Personal (available only online) </td>
          <td align="center"><div align="center">$29.99/sensor</div></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> Business (available via Credit Card (preferred) or Purchase Order)</td>
          <td align="center"><div align="center">$399/sensor </div></td>
        </tr>
