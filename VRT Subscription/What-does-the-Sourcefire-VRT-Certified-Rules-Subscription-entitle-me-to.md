Understanding that attackers are constantly developing new methods of attack, uncovering new vulnerabilities and exploiting known weaknesses in commonly deployed systems, Sourcefire created the Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team (VRT) to ensure our customers stay one step ahead of the latest threats. With this new subscription service, Snort users can benefit from the hard work of this team at the same time Sourcefire customers do. All Sourcefire VRT Certified Rules will be made available to subscribers in real-time as they are released.

Subscribers receive:

* The fastest access to Sourcefire VRT certified rule updates - The same ruleset developed for Sourcefire customers - 30 days faster than registered users.
* Coverage in advance of exploits - The Sourcefire VRT proactively focuses on the underlying vulnerability, rather than simply reacting to known attacks.
* The ability to submit false positives/negatives directly to the Sourcefire VRT for support, assigned a ticket and worked with through the process.
