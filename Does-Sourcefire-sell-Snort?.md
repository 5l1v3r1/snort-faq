## Does Sourcefire sell Snort? ##

While Sourcefire does offer a commercial version of the Snort technology, we do not sell Snort. Sourcefire embraces the open source model and is committed to the GPL. Sourcefire leverages the Snort detection engine and VRT Rules as the foundation for the Sourcefire Next Generation IPS and Next Generation Firewall, adding an easy-to-use interface, optimized hardware, powerful data analysis and reporting, policy management and administration, a full suite of product services, and 24x7 support. All enhancements made to the Snort technology for Sourcefire's commercial offerings are contributed back to the open source community.
